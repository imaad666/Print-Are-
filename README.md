# Print[Are]

Print[Are] is a self-service printing kiosk system that works like an ATM for printing. Here's the user experience:

1. **Approach the kiosk** - A display shows a QR code and status
2. **Scan with your phone** - The QR opens a mobile upload portal
3. **Upload documents** - Select PDFs, images, or documents to print
4. **Get pricing** - System calculates cost based on pages and print quality
5. **Make payment** - Pay securely through UPI
6. **Collect prints** - Your documents print automatically and you collect them

The kiosk handles one user at a time, ensuring privacy and efficient service. Each session is exclusive - once someone starts using it, the QR becomes inactive until they're done.

Perfect for libraries, colleges, offices, or anywhere people need quick, self-service printing without staff assistance.
